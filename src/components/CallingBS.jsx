      <h2>CALLING BULLSHIT</h2>
      <p>
        Any player can call BULLSHIT after any discard. If a player calls
        bullshit, then they must flip the questioned cards over to see if they
        are actually the cards they are supposed to be.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the cards do not match, then the player who discarded them must take
        the whole discard deck into their hand! Yikes!
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other hand, when the cards do match what was claimed, then the
        player who called bullshit must take the whole discard pile into their
        hand. A player may not call BS on themselves.
