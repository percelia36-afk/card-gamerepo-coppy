        But what if you don't have the card you need? For example, if the
        previous player put down two 4s, and you don't have any 5s in your hand,
        aren't you screwed? Hold onto your horses. This is where things get
        interesting! If a player does not have a 5 in hand in this example, they
        may discard an alternative card(s) but still claim it as a 5 and hope
        the other players don't call them out on their bullshit!
      </p>

      <p>
        Alternatively, if you do have one 5 but you'd like to attempt to get rid
        of more cards in your hand, you can bullshit and say you have three 5s,
        and put down two random cards alongside the 5.
